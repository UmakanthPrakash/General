RegEx

I use regex101 for all my regex validations, I feel it has a clear UI where we can test our Regex and also give a short description on the wild characters in our regex

1. Match all the words that starts with abc or def
(^[abc]{3}(.*))|(^[def]{3}(.*))
	Desc of command
	^ indicates starting of the string
	[] encloses the text in context followed by length of the text
	| indicates or since we are looking for either of the terms

2. Similar to above but negation, we want match all except starting with abc or def
^(?!(^[abc]{3}(.*))|(^[def]{3}(.*))).*
	Desc: ?! is the key here, this is for negation

3. Grouping in regex should be done with ()

4. (mytext)(.*$)
	Desc: This expression matches all the characters starting with mytext for instance mytext_asdf_qwe.txt

5. [^\.].*(\.PDF)|.*(\.pdf)|.*(\.tar)+(\.gz)*
	Desc: it will match all file with following extensions .PDF or .pdf or .tar or .tar.gz
			thats the reason + is used with tar and gz

6. ^((?!ABC).)*$
	Desc: This will match all the words that does not start with ABC

7. ^((?!ABC).).*(\.tar)+(\.gz)*
	Desc: Matches all the files which are not starting with ABC<othercharacters>.tar and ABC<othercharacters>.tar.gz

8. ^(?:[\t ]*(?:\r?\n|\r))+
	Desc: Matches the emtpy lines in a text file, with this regex it easy to remove all the blank lines

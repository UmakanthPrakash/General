SSH Key communication

S1(System 1) wants to connect to S2(System 2) via ssh key

Step:1 Run the below command on S1, hit enter, provide filename, passphrase(optional). It will generate keypair (filename, filename.pub)
$ssh-keygen -t rsa

Step:2 Copy public key which in in your local path of S1 to remote S2
$ssh-copy-id -i filename.pub username@S2-IPAddress
	for ex: $ssh-copy-id -i filename.pub appusr@10.1.4.2
This will prompt for appusr password

Step:3 Login to S2 with the new key, here you need you need give the secret key filename, notice I am excluding .pub in the filename
$ssh -i filename appusr@10.1.4.2

This will prompt you for passphrase if you have provided, if not it will login and take you to S2 console.
